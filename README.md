# Awesome LLM for Science and Innovation

> This repository provides a curated collection of research papers, platforms, and case studies on the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for science and innovation.  
> It covers the full workflow from knowledge acquisition and problem generation, idea and hypothesis generation, experiment design and execution, to scientific communication, integrated end-to-end systems, and domain-specific applications.  
> The goal is to serve as a systematic, up-to-date, and centralized resource hub for researchers and practitioners in AI-driven science and innovation.
